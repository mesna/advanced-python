### Advanced Python

A simple program that takes the following CSV (https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price) and tells the user the following information:
  -  What was the greatest percent increase over the previous day, and what day was it
  -  What was the greatest percent decrease over the previous day, and what day was it
  -  What is the highest price in the the data, and what day was it
 
 To run the program simply execute run.bat or run.sh with the csv file location.
 Example:
  - C:\Users\Marko\Documents\Python\advanced-python>run.bat C:\Users\Marko\Downloads\market-price.csv
  
 To run the unittests use python -m unittest.
 Example:
  - C:\Users\Marko\Documents\Python\advanced-python>python -m unittest
